El ejercicio se basa en la Kata Gilded Rose.

La idea del ejercicio es que apliquen conceptos de orientaci�n a objetos, SOLID, Patrones de diseño,
y todo lo que sea necesario para refactorizar este codigo y que quede lo m�s entedible para un usuario.

Dentro del archivo de texto se encuentra una solución aplicada en Java,
dentro del archivo se encuentran dos clases GildedRose y la clase Item.

Se puede desarrollar en cualquier lenguaje orientado a objetos,
la idea es que al finalizar el refactor suban el código finalizado,
asi podemos ir revisandolos entre todos.

Pueden modificar, crear y hacer todos los cambios de clases necesarios respetando el caso de uso en cuestión.

Problem Description

Hi and welcome to team Gilded Rose. As you know, we are a small inn with a prime location in a prominent city
ran by a friendly innkeeper named Allison. We also buy and sell only the finest goods. Unfortunately,
our goods are constantly degrading in quality as they approach their sell by date. We have a system in place
that updates our inventory for us. It was developed by a no-nonsense type named Leeroy, who has moved on
to new adventures. Your task is to add the new feature to our system so that we can begin selling a new
category of items. First an introduction to our system:

    -   All items have a SellIn value which denotes the number of days we have to sell the item
    -   All items have a Quality value which denotes how valuable the item is
    -   At the end of each day our system lowers both values for every item
Pretty simple, right? Well this is where it gets interesting:

    -   Once the sell by date has passed, Quality degrades twice as fast
    -   The Quality of an item is never negative
    -   The Quality of an item is never more than 50
    -   "Aged Brie" actually increases in Quality the older it gets
    -   "Sulfuras", being a legendary item, never has to be sold or decreases in Quality
    -   "Backstage passes", like aged brie, increases in Quality as it's SellIn value approaches;
    -   Quality increases by 2 when there are 10 days or less and by 3 when there are 5 days or less but Quality drops to 0 after the concert
We have recently signed a supplier of conjured items. This requires an update to our system:

    -   "Conjured" items degrade in Quality twice as fast as normal items
Feel free to make any changes to the UpdateQuality method and add any new code as long as everything still
works correctly. However, do not alter the Item class or Items property as those belong to the goblin in
the corner who will insta-rage and one-shot you as he doesn't believe in shared code ownership (you can make
the UpdateQuality method and Items property static if you like, we'll cover for you).
